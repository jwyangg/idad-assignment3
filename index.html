        <h2>Overview of Project</h2>
        <p>
          This project is a fun interactive audio-visual webpage. Users can
          generate and pop bubbles to generate accompanying sounds. The design
          was built based off of the prompts "No text characters" and
          "Skeuomorphism", utilising the advanced JavaScript technique
          "math.random()".
        </p>

        <p>
          The initial inspirations derived from soap bars and its transformation
          into bubbles, naturally provoking the idea to create a system that
          generates bubbles upon clicking.

          <p>
            The webpage applies 'Skeuomorphic Design' to the bubbles that are
            generated. The, almost, transparent bubbles in various colours with
            highlights similarly reflects the aesthetics of bubbles in real
            life. Furthermore, the way the bubbles float up and out of the
            webpage mimics the movement and actions of bubbles.

          <p>
            It is intended that this webpage is just a fun interactive page,
            which gives users the freedom to generate and pop bubbles wherever.
            However, the randomisation makes it contain restriction and
            structure that prevents users from generating the sound, size and
            colour to their preference.

            The pop-up at the beginning, upon visiting the webpage, provides a
            basic introduction to the website. Overall, it is simple enough for
            users to navigate and a page with easy learnability as it only
            requires the user to tap around the canvas.

    <!-- Rationale Section -->
    <section class="rationale-section">
      <h2>Design Rationale</h2>

      <div class="rationale-block">
        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          When approaching the feedback of this system, it was very
          self-explanatory as a result of approaching the design through the
          lens of skeuomorphism. Although in real life, the sounds of bubbles
          forming and popping are almost inaudible, the design intentionally
          exaggerates these cues to provide clear, immediate feedback to the
          user. Each generated bubble is accompanied by a "creation" sound that
          confirms the action, while a satisfying "pop" sound follows when the
          user clicks on a bubble. This not only enhances the tactile and
          playful quality of the interaction but also reinforces a sense of
          cause and effect, allowing users to intuitively understand how their
          actions influence the system. The use of both auditory and visual
          feedback helps make the interface feel responsive, lively, and
          immersive, even without relying on textual instructions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rationale-block">
        <h3>Information Design</h3>
        <p>
          In terms of information design, the project intentionally removes
          textual elements, relying solely on visual and auditory cues to
          communicate interaction possibilities. The layout is very minimal,
          with the entire screen acting as the interactive space, immediately
          signalling that user engagement happens through clicking rather than
          navigating, for example, menus and buttons. However, a button to
          change modes exists, a "sun" and "moon" emoji communicates there being
          a "day" and "night" mode. The colour palette and sound shifts between
          the "day" and "night" mode to communicate environmental context and
          mood. Moreover, the randomly generated bubble sizes and hues introduce
          a sense of variability. The approach that was taken ensure that all
          necessary information, such as interactivity, responsiveness and
          atmosphere, is conveyed intuitively through sensory feedback rather
          than explicit instruction, despite there being an introductory pop-up.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rationale-block">
        <h3>Mapping</h3>
        <p>
          The mapping in this design is direct and intuitive, closely reflecting
          real-world cause and effect relationships. A single click anywhere on
          the screen generates a bubble, while clicking an existing bubble
          causes it to pop. This one-to-one relationship between input and
          output makes the interaction easy to understand without instruction,
          encouraging playful exploration. The toggle between day and night mode
          is similarly straightforward, with immediate visual feedback
          reinforcing the user's control over the environment. By maintaining
          consistent and predictable mappings, the design ensures users can
          quickly grasp the system's logic and engage with it in a natural,
          satisfying way.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rationale-block">
        <h3>Learnability</h3>
        <p>
          The learnability of this system is extremely high due to its
          simplicity and reliance on intuitive, natural interactions. Users can
          immediately understand how to engage with the interface through direct
          manipulation - clicking anywhere generates a bubble, and clicking
          again pops it. The immediate auditory and visual feedback reinforces
          these actions, allowing users to grasp the system's logic within
          seconds. Because the interface avoids text or complex controls, it
          invites experimentation rather than requiring explanation, despite the
          explanatory pop-up. Even the day and night toggle can be discovered
          through exploration, making the experience playful, accessible and
          easy to learn without prior instruction.

    <!-- Changes Section -->
    <section class="changes-section">
      <h2>Significant Changes + Feedback Adjustments</h2>

      <p class="intro-text">
        Following the prototype stage, I made several adjustments to address the
        user feedback received and strengthen the overall interactivity.
      </p>

      <div class="change-group">
        <div class="change-label">Bubbles</div>
        <div class="change-text">
          <p>
            The most notable change was the introduction of the popping
            function. Users are now able to interact with each generated bubble,
            rather than passively watching them fade away, as it was in the
            initial prototype. This shift made the interface feel more dynamic
            and aligned with the playful and tactile associations of real
            bubbles.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also redesigned the sound system, as per feedback, to create
            lighter, bouncier tones that better match the visual characteristics
            of each bubble. Creating the popping functions also required the
            inclusion of appropriate sounds to accompany the popping action.
            Furthermore, the feedback suggested confusion over the randomised
            sounds, so larger bubbles were associated with a lower pitch and
            smaller bubbles were associated with a higher pitch to better fit
            user expectations.
          </p>
          <img src="images/feedback1.png" alt="feedback code 1" />
          <img src="images/feedback2.png" alt="feedback code 2" />
          <p>
            To imprement the sound refinements, I structured the audio logic
            into two separate functions: playSpawnSound() and playPopSound().
            These handle the different sound events. Each function maps the
            bubble's size to the pitch which creates a visual-audio link.
            Implementing the functions was quite simple however, it required an
            excessive amount of trial and error to get the JavaScript to produce
            both sounds AND link the sizes accordingly to sounds. I'm still not
            sure what the reason was, but fortunately I got it to work in the
            end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally, the bubbles were intended to be static on screen with a
            reset button to clear the canvas. In the prototype stage, the
            floating animation was experimented with to see what users thought.
            Through reflection and user testing, it was decided that the
            animations would be kept, with slight adjustments. Instead of the
            bubbles floating up and fading away into the background, the bubbles
            now float, bob side-to-side and disappear from clicks to pop or
            naturally from floating. This approach made the interface feel more
            natural, as a result of the bubbles feeling more alive and being
            slightly more unpredictable, aiding in creating a more engaging user
            experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Visually, I was able to upgrade the bubbles from the flat, opaque
            blue circles by giving each bubble a slightly transparent reflective
            form, making them appear as three-dimensional and organic as
            possible. This was also combined with randomised colours, to enhance
            the unpredictability.
          </p>
          <img
            src="images/Prototype Bubble Design.png"

          <img src="images/Day Bubble Design.png" alt="mid check-in design" />
          <p>
            The prototype was executed via CSS, which then developed to be made
            on JS, and later iterated to create more realistic bubbles that also
            followed the directions of my inspiration. Although I would've loved
            to make the bubbles more transparent and rainbow-like (similar to
            real-life bubbles) but I had difficulty trying to get it to work. In
            hindsight, I feel like it turned out better this way because it
            seems more fun and "child-like." The change isn't drastic from the
            initial JS to the finalised JS design, however, making it more
            "glowy" elevated the overall bubble aesthetic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unrelated to the styling of the bubbles, but I used the standard
            emojis for the day and night icons because I didn't find it
            necessary to find separate icons.

      <div class="change-group">
        <div class="change-label">Background</div>
        <div class="change-text">
          <p>
            Previously, the prototype included a static black background as the
            canvas, but after feedback, it was altered to be an animated CSS
            gradient to mimic water-like properties. Although the animation is
            very subtle and almost unnoticeable, it better supports the
            atmosphere and aids in the immersion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I don't have proof of documentation, I did try to use CSS
            to create ripple-like effects, like water, but I was really
            unsuccessful. The outcome would almost always turn out to be an
            animated pattern, rather than looking like water ripples. It may
            have potentially been different if I also experimented with JS, but
            I didn't want to bother too much because the background being
            animated was just a small detail addition so that it influenced
            immersion.
          </p>

          <p>
            Personally, the initial idea of the webpage felt as though it was
            lacking a certain element, influencing the decision to add the
            animated background, however there was one more addition to the
            design. The biggest conceptual addition was the day and night mode
            toggle, which not only changes the background and bubble colours but
            also alters the sound palette. The sound palette for the day mode is
            lighter and has more of a "popping" property, when bubbles are
            generated, whereas the night mode has slightly more muted, deeper
            sounds. This gives users a reason to experiment with the interface
            longer, highlighting the randomness and visual aesthetics more.

            During my research stages, I discovered that the bubbles could be
            generated via CSS or JS. In the prototype stage I decided to take
            the CSS approach, as it was something I could understand. However, I
            quickly realised there were some limitations for the purpose I was
            using it for. I ended up having to go back and learn the harder
            methods that I was initially avoiding. Alongside this, I was able to
            get help with learning and understanding from a friend whose
            expertise lies in JS. Below shows the before and after of the JS
            page. In the "before," the bubbles were generated via JS but were
            styled with CSS, in the after the full bubble design was with JS and
            the CSS focused on the background styling.

          <img src="images/after.png" alt="js approach" />
          <p>
            Although I had to learn a new method in a very short period of time,
            I was able to execute it faster than expected due to having briefly
            learnt these methods previously, from another project.
            Unfortunately, it still required me to trial and error numerous
            times as I still needed to get used to the new method. In the end,
            I'm very glad I decided to take the more difficult route beause I
            don't think I would've been able to achieve the final outcome to the
            current standard it is at.

              Conducted final quality checks across sound, visuals, and
              interaction. Ensured overall consistency between aesthetic and
              functionality.

          <h3>Most Proud Of</h3>
          <p>
            The visual aesthetic of the project is what I am most proud of.
            Although it was challenging to achieve the desired look through
            JavaScript, the final result successfully captures the playful and
            child-like quality I envisioned. Every element, from the motion of
            the bubbles to their varying colours and sizes worked more
            cohesively than expected to create a satisfying visual experience.
          </p>

            Additionally, the sound design became one of the most rewarding
            aspects of the project. Despite facing significant difficulty when
            creating and adjusting the sounds, the final outcome exceeded
            expectations. The combination of visual and auditory feedback feels
            balanced and immersive, enhancing the overall interaction, to a
            higher standard that I was initially anticipating.

          <h3>Most Challenging</h3>
          <p>
            The most challenging part of the design process was learning and
            applying different JavaScript methods to achieve both the desired
            functionality and aesthetic. Many iterations were needed to
            fine-tune how bubbles behaved and interacted with user input.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it was briefly mentioned, sound manipulation also posed a major
            challenge - specifically, aligning the pitch with bubble size so
            that larger bubbles produced lower tones and smaller ones created
            higher tones. Often times, the sound would still come out to be
            randomised and it required a lot of trial and error. Occasionally,
            if the sizes were correctly matched with the sounds, the actual
            soundscape of the bubbles would turn out to be different to what was
            expected.

        <h3>Looking Further</h3>
        <p>
          If I had more time to continue developing the project, I would have
          liked to explore adding more user-controlled options to expand
          interactivity. This could include a toggle to choose between static
          and dynamic bubble movement, giving users more control over how the
          bubbles behave on screen. I would also introduce settings that allow
          users to switch between random or controlled bubble generation,
          letting them decide whether bubble sizes are entirely randomised or
          follow specific parameters. Additionally, I would experiment with
          non-circular bubble shapes to create a more visually diverse and
          playful experience, pushing the aesthetic beyond traditional bubble
          forms.
